Using CPython 3.13.2
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
  x No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  -> Because there are no versions of https and your project depends on https, we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the --frozen` flag to skip

        It looks like you're trying to install a package with the `uv` package manager (a Python package installer/environment manager), but you're running into an error.

The command `uv add https "mcp[cli]"` is causing an issue because it's trying to interpret "https" as a package name, which doesn't exist as a standalone package on PyPI.

If you're trying to install the `mcp` package with its CLI extras via HTTPS, you should try:

```
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```

If you specifically need to install from a URL, the correct syntax would be:

```
uv add "mcp[cli]" --index-url=https://pypi.org/simple
```

Or if you're trying to install from a specific repository:

```
uv add "mcp[cli]" --find-links=https://your-repository-url
```

Let me know if you're trying to do something different, and I can help you with the correct command!



Before using `uv add` to install packages, you should check if your `pyproject.toml` file is properly set up. This file defines your project's metadata and dependencies.

Here's what you should do:

1. First, make sure your `pyproject.toml` file has the basic required sections. At minimum, it should include:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "your-project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Your project description"
```

2. Then you can run the `uv add` command to add dependencies to your project:

```
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```

If you're starting a new project and don't have a `pyproject.toml` file yet, you might want to initialize a new Python project first with:

```
uv init
```

This will create a basic `pyproject.toml` file that you can then modify.

If you're working within an existing project that already has a `pyproject.toml`, but isn't using `uv` yet, you shouldn't need any special commands - `uv` should be able to work with your existing configuration.

Is your `pyproject.toml` file already set up, or are you creating a new project?


I see the issue now. The error message indicates there's a Python version incompatibility between your project requirements and the `mcp` package.

Your `pyproject.toml` specifies that your project requires Python 3.12 or newer (`requires-python = ">=3.12"`), but the error message suggests that `uv` is trying to resolve dependencies for Python 3.9 (`split (python_full_version == '3.9.*')`).

Furthermore, the error indicates that `mcp[cli]>=1.3.0` requires Python 3.10 or newer, which doesn't match the Python 3.9 version that `uv` is trying to use for resolution.

Here are a few ways to fix this:

1. Make sure you're using Python 3.12+ when running `uv`, since that's what your project requires:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --python=python3.12
   ```

2. Or use the `--frozen` flag as suggested in the error message to skip dependency resolution:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --frozen
   ```

3. You could also try running with your current Python version explicitly:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --python=$(which python)
   ```

It seems like there might be a configuration issue where `uv` isn't recognizing that you're using Python 3.13.2 (as shown in your first message) and is instead trying to resolve for Python 3.9.


I see the issue with the command syntax. The error occurred because there's a syntax error in the command you tried.

Let's fix it. When using `$(which python)`, you need to make sure the command substitution syntax is correct.

Try these corrected commands:

1. If using bash or similar shell:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --python=$(which python)
   ```

2. Or specify the Python version directly:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --python=python3.13
   ```
   
3. Or simply use your system Python without specifying:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0"
   ```

4. Or use the frozen flag to skip dependency resolution:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --frozen
   ```

The error message indicates that there was a problem with a closing parenthesis `)` being in the wrong place. Make sure you're typing the command exactly as shown above.


Thanks for checking your Python version. You're using Python 3.10.14, which explains part of the confusion.

Your `pyproject.toml` file specifies `requires-python = ">=3.12"`, but you're actually running Python 3.10.14. This version mismatch is likely contributing to the dependency resolution issues.

You have two options:

1. Modify your `pyproject.toml` to match your actual Python version:
   ```toml
   requires-python = ">=3.10"
   ```

2. Or use the `--frozen` flag as suggested to bypass dependency resolution:
   ```
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0" --frozen
   ```

Since the `mcp[cli]` package requires Python >=3.10 (as seen in the error message), and you're running 3.10.14, option #1 should work well. After updating your `pyproject.toml`, try running:

```
uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0"
```

The issue was that your project configuration states it needs Python 3.12+, but you're using Python 3.10, which created a conflict during dependency resolution.
